## Summary

I received a challenge to make an application in record time about answer quizzes using an external API to Sharepoint.
This application has been made using React, Sharepoint Framework, and Typescript.

You can select the category in which you receive the questions, it has global game state management, scoring, and sounds when you get a question right or wrong.

Finally, the results are published in a SharePoint list that has a Power Automate trigger to send an email with the results.
